## Fireman: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Fireman videogame!

This is an learning project developed by Armillotta Martino used for learn Unity. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (app data and settings) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | This is the permission for open links |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | This is the permission for open links |
| `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | Thi permsission is required for read the game files |
| `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | Thi permsission is required for write the game files |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Armillotta Martino.
